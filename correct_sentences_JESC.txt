what's the general opinion who did this my guess 
a stalker 
to type in a whole lot of things and to learn
norma here do you read me 
is just simply not going to happen in time 
every single one of us matters 
there is no reason for me to go 
this is what happens when you take away

reflect 
this is how it's gonna be from here on out 
ice that's been frozen for several 100 000 years and is now part of the continent

look i was thinking maybe you know me and you go check out a movie or something 
i knew 
how unfortunate lancer 
i'm a family friend 
he was looking at his hands the whole time he was talking 
because i'll always be at your side
you're not even 30 set for life 
you're not exactly looking for a singular fact anymore
heichan you've been tender
you didn't go to peter and the wolf 
yes it's not far from here 
but actually 
i'll do anything so please spare my daughter 
sara why did you come back 
to a sort of a planetary force here some dark terrible incomprehensible force 
he wants you dead and he will attempt to have you so 
now we will have a greeting from the graduating class 
if you might remember anything about it 
the night we trapped the reverseflash
he always gets drunk and falls 
so the dea wouldn't look into it
but i do think it's possible 
just an advertisement sign 
do you know this morning
i need to get back quickly
well don't act girly 
collapsing all of a sudden like that 
the paintings were taken off the walls of your family home and carefully transported to the belvedere 
i had an entire house before detached and all but i was just tired of the lawn care upkeep and whatnot 
with this patient as soon as she was admitted 
why didn't you tell us 
and there's your redhead 
oh yeah yeah it's over there 
beast with michel 
he's all soft and squishy and malleable 
next item okay 
in that case it's good to see you too 
dumb luck and bad bookkeeping 
thanks for the meal 
oldschool gangster and allaround scumbag 
believe you 
fireworks fireworks 
and look at this okay 
you with the police 
this guy doing it 
i thought that my way of doing things were the best
we're dividing up into two 
that would be a department of justice
so is it out on a trip or not 
hi nice to meet you michael 
reed 
why don't you come sit down with me 
i won't let my children face any hardships
and on my weekends i would go up just like all the other tourists
your work has been very impressive so far 
the emergence of the design profession
the problem is that when you look about the west
in a difficult time 
all right i'll fight 
if i was a father to any of my children they'd be stoned in the streets 
create the drugs and industrial molecules we want
might be able to narrow down a location using triangulation 
my dad's gonna be back 
you can walk with me to scotland 
lights out 
ii'm fine 
replaced in the name of progress 
what are they teaching these kids
will do 
oh i'm sorry it's okay 
oh i know it's tanigawa 
i don't know you're the expert 
hold it 
how do you mean 
i'm tired 
work up whatever you can 
no that's not it that's not it 
listen right now it's impossible
i hope if there is a result that kissed 
am i free to go 
you'll definitely become a good nurse 
and isn't that what your facemash was about 
what is it this time 
you poured your father's remains in and closed it
